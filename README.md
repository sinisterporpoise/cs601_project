Changes for 4/6/2023

1. Changed number of features used to 10, becausee we have a relatively small number of features and this improved accuracy
2. Decided accuracy was the correct measure for this because false negative and false positive doesn't mean much for wine quality (Perhaps this wasn't a good set)
3. Began to compare the model to skelarn's rando forest
